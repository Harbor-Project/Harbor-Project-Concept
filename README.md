## ■ Overview  
Harbor Project is a Japan-originated concept that proposes a low-cost, anonymous, and immediately accessible evidence-preservation kit designed to support both survivors of sexual violence and individuals falsely accused of sexual misconduct.

The goal is not to create confrontation.  
The goal is to place **one additional safe harbor** for any person who is trapped in silence.

---

## ■ Why This Matters  
- Sexual violence cases often lack physical evidence.  
- False accusations are equally destructive, yet hard to disprove.  
- Society demands “proof,” but offers **no accessible system** to obtain it.  

Harbor Project attempts to fill this structural void.

- Sterile swabs  
- pH-stable collection sheet

## ■ Logo Concepts (Draft)
1. **Minimal lighthouse + dual light beams**  
2. **Lighthouse + horizontal sea line**  
3. **Lighthouse + sea + light fan**  

All express the core philosophy:  
**“Light for both sides.”**

---

## ■ Philosophy  
- Lighthouse (white): safety and integrity  
- Sea (blue): neutrality and universality  
- Symmetrical beams: illuminating both survivors and the falsely accused  

Harbor Project is not political activism.  
It is a quiet, infrastructural offering.
